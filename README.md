# KSP Community Fixes

This plugin is a collection of code patches for fixing bugs and performance issues in the KSP codebase, and adding small QoL improvements. Entirely new features (especially those already covered by other mods) are out of scope, as well as patches that might alter the stock behaviors to minimize potential mod compatibility issues.

This mod is meant as community project, so feel free to propose additional patch ideas by opening an issue, or to contribute with a pull request.

### Download and installation

Compatible with **KSP 1.8.0** to **1.12.5** - Available on [CKAN]

**Required** and **must be downloaded separately** : 

- **HarmonyKSP** : **[Download](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/HarmonyKSP/releases)** - [Homepage](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/HarmonyKSP/) - Available on [CKAN]
- **ModuleManager** : **[Download](https://ksp.sarbian.com/jenkins/job/ModuleManager/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/)** - [Forum post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-18x-110x-module-manager-414-july-7th-2020-locked-inside-edition/) - Available on [CKAN]

**Installation**

- Go to the **[GitHub release page](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/releases)** and download the file named `KSPCommunityFixes_x.x.x.zip`
- Open the downloaded *.zip archive
- Open the `GameData` folder of your KSP installation
- Delete any existing `KSPCommunityFixes` folder in your `GameData` folder
- Copy the `KSPCommunityFixes` folder found in the archive into your `GameData` folder

### Features

Individual patches can be enabled or disabled by editing the `Settings.cfg` file. To make sure your changes persist when the mod is updated, it is recommended to make them in a ModuleManager patch. Open the `Extras\KSPCF_UserSettings.cfg.extra` file in a text editor for further instructions.

While all KSP versions from 1.8.0 to 1.12.5 are supported, using the latest one (1.12.5) is highly recommended, as many patches only apply to the most recent KSP versions. When a bug fix patch doesn't apply to an older KSP version, this **doesn't** mean those bugs don't exist there.

User options are available from the "ESC" in-game settings menu :<br/><img src="https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/raw/master/Screenshots/settings.gif"/>

#### Major bugfixes

- **RefundingOnRecovery** [KSP 1.11.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Vessel recovery funds properly account for modules implementing IPartCostModifier. This bug affect stock fairings, cargo parts and many modules from various mods (part switchers and procedural parts mods, USI, Kerbalism, Tweakscale, etc).
- **KerbalInventoryPersistence** [KSP 1.12.2 - 1.12.5]<br/>Fix the whole kerbal inventory persistence system being inactive in KSP 1.12.2+. This cause multiple issues, like being able to bypass kerbal inventories mass/volume limits, and various cargo part duplication / disappearance issues when EVAing / boarding.
- **[RoboticsDrift](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/13)** [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Prevent unrecoverable part position drift of Breaking Grounds DLC robotic parts and their children parts.
- **DockingPortRotationDriftAndFixes** [KSP 1.12.5]<br/>Make the stock docking port rotation feature actually useable :
  - Completely prevent unrecoverable position drift of children parts of docking ports.
  - Fix joint failure and phantom forces when a docking port pair is set to opposite extreme angles.
  - Allow tweaking the rotation in the editor and while not docked in flight.
  - Rotation can now be properly used in a robotic controller.
  - Remove the -86°/86° hardcoded limitation of `hardMinMaxLimits`, it is now -180°/180°.
  - Fix many issues and state inconsistencies.
  - An optional `DockingPortExtendedRotation.cfg.extra` MM patch extending rotation range to 360° is available in the `Extras` folder. Copy it to your `GameData` folder and remove the `.extra` extension to use it.
- **[AutoStrutDrift](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/21)** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Improves the overall physics stability when using autostruts and prevent autostrut induced deformations following vessel modification events (decoupling, docking/undocking, fairing separation...).
- **ModuleIndexingMismatch** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Prevent modules persisted state from being lost in existing saves/ships following a mod installation/uninstallation/update. Note that this won't handle all cases, but it massively reduce occurrences of that issue.
- **PackedPartsRotation** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Fix part rotations not being reset to their pristine value when a non-landed vessel is packed, resulting in permanent part rotation drift when docking and other minor/cosmetic issues.
- **[PartStartStability](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/9)** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Fix vessel deformation and kraken events on flight scene load, also prevent some kraken issues when placing parts with EVA construction.

#### Minor bugfixes

- **ExtendedDeployableParts** [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Fix deployable parts (antennas, solar panels, radiators...) always starting in the extended state when the model isn't exported in the retracted state. This bug affect parts from various mods (ex : Ven's stock revamp solar panels).
- **[DeltaVHideWhenDisabled](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/31)** [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Hide the stock stage delta-v UI elements and navball extended burn info when `DELTAV_CALCULATIONS_ENABLED` and `DELTAV_APP_ENABLED` are disabled by another mod or in the KSP `settings.cfg` file.
- **AsteroidSpawnerUniqueFlightId** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Fix the asteroid/comet spawner generating non-unique `Part.flightId` identifiers.

- **AltimeterHorizontalPosition** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Altimeter widget horizontal position is now tweakable in the pause menu settings.<br/><img src="https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/raw/master/Screenshots/AltimeterHorizontalPosition.gif" width="500"/>
- **PAWStockGroups** [KSP 1.10.1 - 1.12.5]<br/>Part Action Window groups for a selection of stock items/modules<br/><img src="https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/raw/master/Screenshots/PAWGroups.png" width="500"/>
- **[TweakableWheelsAutostrut](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/16)** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Allow tweaking the autostrut mode of wheels/landing legs. Still default to "Heaviest part".<br/><img src="https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/raw/master/Screenshots/TweakableWheelsAutostrut.gif"/>
- **AutostrutActions** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Allow autostrut mode to be toggled with action groups (requires advanced tweakables to be enabled).
- **UIFloatEditNumericInput** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Allow numeric input ("#" button) in "float edit" PAW items<br/><img src="https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/raw/master/Screenshots/UIFloatEditNumericInput.gif"/>
- **DisableManeuverTool** [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Allow disabling the KSP 1.12 maneuver/trip planner tool in the KSPCF in-game settings menu. It can cause stutters and freezes on scene load, when changing SOI or when editing maneuver nodes, especially with Kopernicus modified systems.
- **FairingMouseOverPersistence** [KSP 1.10.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Make the "Fairing Expansion" state persistent when reloading a craft in the editor.
- **HidePartUpgradeExtendedInfo** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Hides irrelevant extended info on the part tooltip for PartUpgrades in the RnD screen.

- **NoIVA** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Allow to disable IVA functionality and prevent related assets from being loaded, reducing RAM/VRAM usage and slightly increasing performance in some cases. Has a "use placeholder IVA" option allowing to keep crew portraits. This patch is disabled by default and must be enabled from the KSP "ESC" settings menu. It has no entry in the `Settings.cfg` file and require a restart to take effect. Do not use this option alongside IVA mods like RPM or MAS.
- **DisableNewGameIntro** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Disable the "intro" popups appearing in the space center, VAB/SPH and tracking station upon creating a new career game. Disabled by default.

- **ResourceLockActions** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Add part actions for locking/unlocking resources flow state.

#### Performance tweaks 

- **SceneLoadSpeedBoost** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Reduce scene switches loading time with large/modded saves by caching the current save in memory instead of loading it from disk.
- **OnDemandPartBuoyancy** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Prevent the part buoyancy integrator from running when not needed. Improves performance for large part count vessels while in the SOI of a body that has an ocean (Kerbin, Eve, Laythe...)
- [**FastLoader**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/108) [KSP 1.12.3 - 1.12.5]<br/>Complete rewrite of the KSP asset/part loader : prevent GPU framerate limits from affecting loading speed, implement multithreaded asset loading (20% to 40% speedup depending on CPU & storage specs), provides an opt-in mechanism for caching PNG textures in the DXT5 format, also implements loading of additional DDS formats (see **BetterDDSSupport** patch in the API/modding tools section).
- **PQSUpdateNoMemoryAlloc** [KSP 1.11.0 - 1.12.5]<br/> Prevent huge memory allocations and resulting occasional stutter on PQS creation happening when moving around near a body surface.
- [**PQSCoroutineLeak**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/85) [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Prevent KSP from spawning multiple PQS update coroutines for the same PQS after scene switches and on other occasions, causing large performance degradation over time.
- [**MemoryLeaks**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/49) [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Fix a bunch of managed memory leaks, mainly by proactively removing `GameEvents` delegates originating from destroyed `UnityEngine.Object` instances on scene switches. Will log detected leaks and memory usage. Also see`Settings.cfg` to enable advanced logging options that can be useful to hunt down memory leaks in mods.
- [**ProgressTrackingSpeedBoost**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/57) [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Remove unused ProgressTracking update handlers. Provides a very noticeable performance uplift in career games having a large amount of celestial bodies and/or vessels.
- [**DisableMapUpdateInFlight**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/59) [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Disable the update of orbit lines and markers in flight when the map view isn't shown. Provides decent performance gains in games having a large amount of celestial bodies and/or vessels.
- [**CommNetThrottling**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/56) [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Disabled by default, you can enable it with a MM patch. Prevent full CommNet network updates from happening every frame, but instead to happen at a regular real-world time interval of 5 seconds while in flight. Enabling this can provide a decent performance uplift in games having an large amount of celestial bodies and/or vessels, but has a detrimental impact on the precision of the simulation and can potentially cause issues with mods relying on the stock behavior.
- [**AsteroidAndCometDrillCache**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/67) [KSP 1.12.5]<br/>Reduce constant overhead of ModuleAsteroidDrill and ModuleCometDrill by using the cached asteroid/comet part lookup results from ModuleResourceHarvester. Improves performance with large part count vessels having at least one drill part.
- [**FewerSaves**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/80) [KSP 1.8.0 - KSP 1.12.5]<br/>Disables saving on exiting Space Center minor buildings (Mission Control etc) and when deleting vessels in Tracking Station. Disabled by default.
- [**ConfigNodePerf**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/88) [see also](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/90) [KSP 1.8.0 - KSP 1.12.5]<br/>Speeds up many ConfigNode methods, especially reading and writing ConfigNodes.
- [**RestoreMaxPhysicsDT**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/95) [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>When using physics warp, Unity will set the max physics dt to be at least as high as the scaled physics dt. But KSP will never restore it back to the normal value from the settings. This can degrade performance as it allows more FixedUpdates to run per frame.
- [**ContractProgressEnumCache**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/100) [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Prevent performance drops when there are in-progress comet sample or rover construction contracts
- [**DragCubeGeneration**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/139) [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5]<br/> Faster and more reliable implementation of drag cube generation. Improves overall loading times (both game load and scene/vessel/ship load times), prevent occasional lag spikes (in the editor mostly) and fix some issues causing incorrect drag cubes to be generated (notable examples are the stock inflatable heat shield, the 1.25m and 2.5m nose cones and the Mainsail shroud). Note that by design, this patch results in a small deviation from the stock behavior for buyoancy, aerodynamics and thermodynamics, as the generated drag cubes will be slightly different.
- **LocalizerPerf** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Faster and minimal-allocation replacements for the `Localizer.Format()` methods, can provide significant speedup for GUI-heavy mods using localized strings.
- [**DisableHiddenPortraits**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/84) [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Prevent non-visible crew portraits from being rendered after a switch back from the map view (and other cases), causing a significant perf hit when there are many kerbals in the vessel.

#### API and modding tools
- **MultipleModuleInPartAPI** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>This API allow other plugins to implement PartModules that can exist in multiple occurrence in a single part and won't suffer "module indexing mismatch" persistent data losses following part configuration changes. [See documentation on the wiki](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/wiki/MultipleModuleInPartAPI).
- **DockingPortLockedEvents** [KSP 1.12.2 - 1.12.5]<br/>Disabled by default, you can enable it with a MM patch. Fire GameEvents onRoboticPartLockChanging/onRoboticPartLockChanged respectively before/after calls to ModuleDockingNode.ModifyLocked(), following a modification of the ModuleDockingNode.nodeIsLocked field.
- **OnSymmetryFieldChanged** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/> Disabled by default, you can enable it with a MM patch. Change the `UI_Control.onSymmetryFieldChanged` callback to behave identically to the `UI_Control.onFieldChanged` callback :
  - The callback will only be called when the field value has actually been modified.
  - The "object" argument will contain the previous field value (instead of the new value).
- **PersistentIConfigNode** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Implement `IConfigNode` members marked as `[Persistent]` serialization support when using the `CreateObjectFromConfig()`, `LoadObjectFromConfig()` and `CreateConfigFromObject()` methods. Also implements `Guid` serialization support for those methods. Includes a complete rewrite of underlying ConfigNode code (in line with ConfigNodePerf) for performance, lower GC impact, and to fix some stock bugs.
- **ReflectionTypeLoadExceptionHandler** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Patch the BCL `Assembly.GetTypes()` method to always handle (gracefully) an eventual `ReflectionTypeLoadException`. Since having an assembly failing to load is a quite common scenario, this ensure such a situation won't cause issues with other plugins. Those exceptions are logged (but not re-thrown), and detailed information about offending plugins is shown on screen during loading so users are aware there is an issue with their install. This patch is always enabled and has no entry in `Settings.cfg`.
- **[DepartmentHeadImage](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/47)** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/> Fix administration building custom departement head image not being used when added by a mod.
- **[ModUpgradePipeline](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/91)** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>This will save mod versions in sfs and craft files, and use those versions for mods' SaveUpgradePipeline scripts so that mods can handle their own upgrade versioning using native KSP tools instead of having to always run their upgrade scripts.
- **BetterDDSSupport** [KSP 1.12.3 - 1.12.5]<br/>Implement compatibility with the DXT10/DXGI specification, and support of loading additional texture formats :
  - `BC4` : single channel (R) compressed 4 bpp 
  - `BC5` : 2 channels (RG) compressed 8 bpp
  - `BC6H` : 3 channels (RGB) compressed 8 bpp with HDR color range (**Not available on MacOS**)
  - `BC7` : 4 channels (RGBA) compressed 8 bpp (**Not available on MacOS**)
  - `R16G16B16A16` : 4 channels (RGBA) uncompressed 64 bpp
  - `R16_FLOAT` / `R32_FLOAT` : single channel (R) uncompressed 16/32 bpp 
  - `R16G16_FLOAT` / `R32G32_FLOAT` : 2 channels (RG) uncompressed 32/64 bpp
  - `R16G16B16A16_FLOAT` / `R32G32B32A32_FLOAT` : 4 channels (RGBA) uncompressed 64/128 bpp 

#### Stock configs tweaks
- **[ManufacturerFixes](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/62)**<br/>Fix a bunch of stock parts not having manufacturers, add icons for the stock "Stratus Corporation" and "LightYear Tire Company" and two new agents, "FreeFall Parachutes" and "Clamp-O-Tron".
- **[LandingGearLights](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/122)**<br/>Fix the lights on the "LY-10" and "LY-35" landing gears not automatically turning on/off when extending/retracting the landing gear.

### License

MIT

### Localization

This mod supports localization. If you wish to contribute a localization file, you can have the mod generate or update a language template by editing the `Settings.cfg` (see instructions near the end of the file).

### Building

After loading the solution in your IDE, add a `ReferencePath` pointing to the root of your KSP install :

For Visual Studio, right-click on the `KSPCommunityFixes` project > `Properties` > `Reference Paths`, add the path to your KSP install and save the changes. Closing and re-opening the solution might be needed for the changes to propagate.

Alternatively, you can do that manually by creating a `KSPCommunityFixes.csproj.user` file next to the `KSPCommunityFixes.csproj` file, with the following content :
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project ToolsVersion="Current" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <ReferencePath>Absolute\Path\To\Your\KSP\Install\Folder</ReferencePath>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
Then close / re-open the solution.

Building in the `Debug` configuration will update the `GameData` folder in your KSP install, building in the `Release` configuration will additionally create a zipped release in the `Releases` repository root folder.

For incrementing the version, edit the `KSPCommunityFixes.version` KSP-AVC file, changes will be propagated to `AssemblyInfo.cs` when building in the `Release` configuration.

The `Start` action of the IDE will trigger a build, update the `GameData` files in the KSP install and launch KSP.
If doing so in the `Debug` configuration and if your KSP install is modified to be debuggable, you will be able to debug the code from within your IDE (if your IDE provides Unity debugging support).

### Changelog

##### 1.32.0

##### 1.28.1
- **DragCubeGeneration** : fixed [issue #146](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/146), cache concurrency issues causing `InvalidOperation` exceptions and more generally incorrect drag cubes on dynamic editor/flight drag cube generation.

##### 1.28.0
- New KSP bugfix : [**ReRootPreserveSurfaceAttach**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/142) [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5], disable the stock behavior of altering surface attachment nodes on re-rooting, a questionable QoL feature that doesn't work correctly, leading to permanently borked attachement nodes.

- New performance patch : [**DisableHiddenPortraits**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/84) [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5], prevent non-visible crew portraits from being rendered after a switch back from the map view (and other cases), causing a significant perf hit when there are many kerbals in the vessel.
- New performance/bugfix patch : [**DragCubeGeneration**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/139) [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5], faster and more reliable implementation of drag cube generation. Improves overall loading times (both game load and scene/vessel/ship load times), prevent occasional lag spikes (in the editor mostly) and fix some issues causing incorrect drag cubes to be generated (notable examples are the stock inflatable heat shield, the 1.25m and 2.5m nose cones and the Mainsail shroud). Note that by design, this patch results in a small deviation from the stock behavior for buyoancy, aerodynamics and thermodynamics, as the generated drag cubes will be slightly different.
- **DisableManeuverTool** : added MM-patcheable flags to set the default enabled state of the maneuver tool or to forcefully disable it, see `Settings.cfg`.

##### 1.27.0
- New performance patch : **LocalizerPerf** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5] Faster and minimal-allocation replacements for the Localizer.Format() methods, can provide significant speedup for GUI-heavy mods using localized strings.
- **FastLoader** : Faster implementation of the stock `translateLoadedNodes` method, can reduce loading time by up to 30 seconds in a heavily modded install (thanks to @siimav for spotting this).
- **LandingGearLights** : fixed the patch not applying to the smaller LY-10 landing gear (Thanks to @JonnyOThan).
- Fixed [issue #98](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/98) : **ConfigNodePerf** patch ignoring the last key/value pair when parsing a node-less, values only input. Notably fix a compatibility issue with the SimpleConstruction mod causing missing vessel construction costs.

##### 1.26.0

- New KSP bugfix/QoL patch, **LadderToggleableLight** : fix for the stock "Kelus-LV Bay Mobility Enhancer" light being always active even when the ladder is retracted, and implements manual control of the light.

##### 1.25.5
- Fixed [issue #134](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/133) : fix for [issue #133](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/133) was overly conservative, causing loading to stop on exceptions that don't cause a fatal error in stock.

##### 1.25.4
- Fixed [issue #133](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/133) : FastLoader allow the game to launch even when unrecoverable errors happen during loading.

- New modding patch : [ModUpgradePipeline](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/91) (@NathanKell)
- Further improve ConfigNode performance. The tunable settings blocks have been removed since base performance is high enough now. They've been replaced by a single setting that enables not indenting save games and craft files on save, which offers a slight performance boost reading and writing and a fair amount of savings on disk. See https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/90 for full details. Note that some of this rewrite is done via PersistentIConfigNode. (@NathanKell)
- Add a KSPAssembly attribute to the dll.

- New KSP bugfix : [AsteroidInfiniteMining](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/51) (Thanks to @Rodg88 for reporting).

##### 1.18.3
- MemoryLeaks : Only remove GameEvent delegates owned by destroyed UnityEngine.Object instances if they are declared by the stock assembly, or a PartModule, or a VesselModule. Some mods are relying on a singleton pattern by instantiating a KSPAddon once, registering GameEvents there and relying on those being called on the dead instance to manipulate static data (sigh...). Those cases will still be logged when the LogDestroyedUnityObjectGameEventsLeaks flag is set in settings.

##### 1.18.2
- Fixed MemoryLeaks patch causing KSC facilities upgrades being reverted after a scene change.

##### 1.18.1
- Fixed AutostrutActions patch causing nullrefs on part duplication and generally not working as intended.

##### 1.18.0
- New performance patch : [MemoryLeaks](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/49)

##### 1.16.1
- RoboticsDrift : fix "Servo info not found" log spam originating from servo parts for which the drift correction isn't enabled.

##### 1.16.0
- New KSP bugfix : [EVAKerbalRecovery](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/43) (thanks to @JonnyOThan for bug-reporting)
- FairingMouseOverPersistence : patch now only applies to KSP 1.10.0 and latter, as the field it relies on doesn't exists in prior versions, causing exceptions in OnLoad()/OnSave().
- Codebase cleaning pass, analyzers are now happy (or silenced).

##### 1.15.0
- New KSP bugfix : [ScatterDistribution](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/41) (thanks to @R-T-B)
- New KSP bugfix : [LostSoundAfterSceneSwitch](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/42) (thanks to @ensou04)
- Fixed KerbalInventoryPersistence patch not being applied on KSP 1.12.3

##### 1.14.1
- Fix KSPCF [issue #39](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/39) : AltimeterHorizontalPosition patch causes state inconsistencies with vessel filters.
- Fix KSPCF [issue #40](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/40) : UIFloatEditNumericInput patch breaking IR custom FloatEdit control. Don't alter the control prefab list, instead return our custom prefab on the fly in the KSP methods searching the prefab list.

##### 1.14.0
- New KSP bugfix : PartListTooltipIconSpin (investigation efforts by @StoneBlue).
- New KSP bugfix : AsteroidSpawnerUniqueFlightId
- New QoL patch : DisableNewGameIntro
- New performance patch : PQSUpdateNoMemoryAlloc (investigation and fix by @Linx).
- Updated Harmony to v2.2.1
- Fixed multiple RoboticsDrift patch issues: 
  - Improved general numerical stability by normalizing input/output Quaternions.
  - Fixed potential NRE spam happening after in-flight vessel hierarchy changes (ie, docking/undocking/decoupling...)
  - Fixed random child-parts-of-robotic-part displacement after timewarping/reloading (bug introduced with the changes made in 1.12.2)
  - Modded robotic parts whose `servoTransform` has a position offset relative to the part origin (either due to non-zero local position in the model hierarchy or a position offset in the part config `MODEL{}` node) are now unsupported. This mean drift correction won't be applied for them, and the stock behavior will apply. KSPCF will issue a log warning when unsupported parts are loaded in flight. Note that such a configuration isn't fully supported by stock either, and such parts will also have issues when manipulating their angle in the editor. And while I *might* find a way to fix this issue in the future, I strongly recommend mod authors to check/alter their models to ensure the `servoTransform` has a zero relative position/rotation from the model root. As of writing, this issue notably affect the BDB Skylab truss, the "More Servos" mod by @Angel-125 and possibly others. 

##### 1.13.2
- RoboticsDrift : fixed a rotation offset being wrongly applied to child parts of translation servos following the fix for issue #35 released in KSPCF 1.12.2 (see [report 1](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/204002-18-112-kspcommunityfixes-bugfixes-and-qol-tweaks/&do=findComment&comment=4132262), [report 2](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/13#issuecomment-1126797719))

##### 1.13.1
- Fixed NoIVA patch causing missing part textures when the part reuse/share IVA textures (ex : SXT). Note that this change negate the loading time gains of the original patch, and might even cause a small increase (a few seconds) if KSP isn't running from a SSD.

##### 1.13.0
- New modding patch : ReflectionTypeLoadExceptionHandler
- New QoL patch : ShowContractFinishDates, contributed by @NathanKell
- New QoL patch : NoIVA
- Added localization support
- Added tooltips to in-game settings

##### 1.12.2
- RoboticsDrift : fixed issue [#35](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/35), incorrect handling of non-stock servo parts having `MODEL{}` rotation/position offsets and/or a model hierarchy where the rotation transform has a position/rotation offset relative to the model root. Notably fixes incorrect behavior with the BDB [Hokulani OCO-RT90 Truss Structure](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/122020-1123-bluedog-design-bureau-stockalike-saturn-apollo-and-more-v1101-%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B0-24apr2022/&do=findComment&comment=4128194).

- DockingPortRotationDriftAndFixes : fixed autostruts crossing docking ports not being disabled if only one of the port pair is rotation-unlocked.

##### 1.11.1
- TextureLoaderOptimizations hotfix : was causing loading to hang on KSP 1.10 and 1.11 due to using an Unity method only available since KSP 1.12. Will restore compatbility latter, for now the patch is disabled for all versions below 1.12.
- AutoStrutDrift bugfix : fixed potential ArgumentOutOfRangeException.

##### 1.11.0
- New bugfix : ExtendedDeployableParts
- New performance tweak : TextureLoaderOptimizations
- new Qol tweak : HidePartUpgradeExtendedInfo, courtesy of @NathanKell (see [PR#29](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/29))

##### 1.10.1
DockingPortRotationDriftAndFixes refinements :
- Fixed the stock implementation being unable to handle a rotating docking ports when it is the root part (was throwing exceptions and generally wasn't working correctly)
- Fixed another stock bug : having a `rotationAxis` other than "Y" result in the docking port still rotating around the Y axis. This bug affect the 2 "inline" stock docking port parts.
- Fixed KSPCF bug : parent port not being able to rotate after re-docking
- Fixed KSPCF bug : things were not working as expected when using a rotating + non-rotating docking port pair
- Fixed KSPCF bug : prevent rotation being available when about to dock or after undocking when the other docking port is "acquired" but not docked.

- RoboticsDrift : fixed incorrect handling when a robotic part is the vessel root part
- Prevent some patches failing with a `ReflectionTypeLoadException` when another plugin assembly fail to load (ex : the Sandcastle/EL integration assembly)

##### 1.9.1
- RoboticsDrift : fixed (harmless) `[RoboticsDrift] Servo info not found...` log spam when toggling the locked state of a robotic part in the editor

- New bugfix : PartStartStability, see [issue #9](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/9).
- The FlightSceneLoadKraken patch is superseded by the PartStartStability patch, which is now disabled by default
- Fixed a silly mistake with the OnDemandPartBuoyancy patch where it would prevent part buoyancy from running if the vessel is already below water at scene load. Thanks to @DRVeyl for catching that.

##### 1.7.0
- New performance patch : OnDemandPartBuoyancy (thanks to @siimav)
- New bugfix : ROCValidationOOR (thanks to @R-T-B)

##### 1.6.1
- Fixed version file for 1.12.3

##### 1.6.0
- Updated for KSP 1.12.3

- New performance patch : SceneLoadSpeedBoost
- New QoL patch : DisableManeuverTool

##### 1.5.0
- New bugfix : KerbalTooltipMaxSustainedG
- Fixed (again...) some patches not being applied

##### 1.4.2
- Fixed ModuleIndexingMismatch patch causing issues with modules dynamically adding/removing resources. Specifically, the patch was causing part resources to be loaded before (instead of after in stock) the `PartModule.OnLoad()` call when loading a `ShipConstruct`. This notably fixes RealFuel resources being lost when reloading/launching a craft file, but that mistake likely had consequences for other fuel/resource switchers mods (B9PS, Firespitter...)

##### 1.4.1
- Fixed UIFloatEditNumericInput patch causing various errors and generally not working as intended.
