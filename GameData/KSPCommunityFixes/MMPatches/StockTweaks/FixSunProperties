//Calculating the gravitational constant G by dividing Kerbin's given gravitational parameter (GM = 3531600000000) 
//by it's listed mass (5.29151583439215E+22) provides a value of 0.000000000066740800000000100000, approximately 6.67408E-11.

//A gravitational parameter was also calculated from the body's geeASL and radius with the following derived formula: geeASL * 9.80665 * radius * radius
//This second GM was compared to the first via subtraction to test accuracy of all given values (geeASL, radius, mass, GM) and zero difference was found.

//All other bodies in the stock system give the same results (save some floating point error such as is present in the value of G listed above),
//EXCEPT the Sun, which, when plugging in its listed GM (1172332794832490000) and M (1.75656696858329E+28) 
//results in a value for G of 6.674E-11, ignoring the 8E-16 term. While minimal, this appears to be an oversight.

//Additionally, plugging in the Sun's provided geeASL (1.7462500333786) and radius (261600000) calculates an alternative GM of 1171932456926000000, 
//different than the first by ~0.034%).

//Assuming precidence of the given radius and mass, and using the standard G value of 6.67408E-11 (as all other bodies use this),
//a new GM can be calculated, equal to 1172346847368240000. Likewise a new geeASL can be calculated, granting a new value of 1.74686750012706.
//To confirm accuracy, an alternate GM was calculated from this new geeASL and the radius, which also gave 1172346847368240000, a difference of zero.
//(Subtracting the values from one another gave me a difference of 1024 (an error of < 9E-16), which is likely attributable to floating point error.)

//Again, while a minimal error, of ~0.034% (or a bit more than 1 in 3000), it is not entirely insignificant.
//This aims to fix the incorrect geeASL and gravParameter of the Sun for proper in-game information display, 
//and potential calculations (or at least in mods that may utilize such information, such as Principia).
