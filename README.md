# KSP Community Fixes

This plugin is a collection of code patches for fixing bugs and performance issues in the KSP codebase, and adding small QoL improvements. Entirely new features (especially those already covered by other mods) are out of scope, as well as patches that might alter the stock behaviors to minimize potential mod compatibility issues.

This mod is meant as community project, so feel free to propose additional patch ideas by opening an issue, or to contribute with a pull request.

### Download and installation

Compatible with **KSP 1.8.0** to **1.12.5** - Available on the [CKAN] mod manager

**Required** and **must be downloaded separately** : 

- **HarmonyKSP** : **[Download](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/HarmonyKSP/releases)** - [Homepage](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/HarmonyKSP/) - Available on [CKAN]
- **ModuleManager** : **[Download](https://ksp.sarbian.com/jenkins/job/ModuleManager/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/)** - [Forum post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-18x-110x-module-manager-414-july-7th-2020-locked-inside-edition/) - Available on [CKAN]

[CKAN]: https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/releases

**Installation**

Installation with [CKAN] is recommended.  Otherwise:

- Go to the **[GitHub release page](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/releases)** and download the file named `KSPCommunityFixes_x.x.x.zip`
- Open the downloaded *.zip archive
- Open the `GameData` folder of your KSP installation
- Delete any existing `KSPCommunityFixes` folder in your `GameData` folder
- Copy the `KSPCommunityFixes` folder found in the archive into your `GameData` folder

### Features

Individual patches can be enabled or disabled by editing the `Settings.cfg` file. To make sure your changes persist when the mod is updated, it is recommended to make them in a ModuleManager patch. Open the `Extras\KSPCF_UserSettings.cfg.extra` file in a text editor for further instructions.

While all KSP versions from 1.8.0 to 1.12.5 are supported, using the latest one (1.12.5) is highly recommended, as many patches only apply to the most recent KSP versions. When a bug fix patch doesn't apply to an older KSP version, this **doesn't** mean those bugs don't exist there.

User options are available from the "ESC" in-game settings menu :<br/><img src="https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/raw/master/Screenshots/settings.gif"/>

#### Major bugfixes

- **RefundingOnRecovery** [KSP 1.11.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Vessel recovery funds properly account for modules implementing IPartCostModifier. This bug affect stock fairings, cargo parts and many modules from various mods (part switchers and procedural parts mods, USI, Kerbalism, Tweakscale, etc).
- **KerbalInventoryPersistence** [KSP 1.12.2 - 1.12.5]<br/>Fix the whole kerbal inventory persistence system being inactive in KSP 1.12.2+. This cause multiple issues, like being able to bypass kerbal inventories mass/volume limits, and various cargo part duplication / disappearance issues when EVAing / boarding.
- **[RoboticsDrift](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/13)** [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Prevent unrecoverable part position drift of Breaking Grounds DLC robotic parts and their children parts.
- **DockingPortRotationDriftAndFixes** [KSP 1.12.5]<br/>Make the stock docking port rotation feature actually useable :
  - Completely prevent unrecoverable position drift of children parts of docking ports.
  - Fix joint failure and phantom forces when a docking port pair is set to opposite extreme angles.
  - Allow tweaking the rotation in the editor and while not docked in flight.
  - Rotation can now be properly used in a robotic controller.
  - Remove the -86°/86° hardcoded limitation of `hardMinMaxLimits`, it is now -180°/180°.
  - Fix many issues and state inconsistencies.
  - An optional `DockingPortExtendedRotation.cfg.extra` MM patch extending rotation range to 360° is available in the `Extras` folder. Copy it to your `GameData` folder and remove the `.extra` extension to use it.
- **[AutoStrutDrift](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/21)** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Improves the overall physics stability when using autostruts and prevent autostrut induced deformations following vessel modification events (decoupling, docking/undocking, fairing separation...).
- [**ModuleIndexingMismatch**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/264) [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Prevent modules persisted state from being lost in existing saves/ships following a mod installation/uninstallation/update. Note that this won't handle all cases, but it massively reduce occurrences of that issue.
- **PackedPartsRotation** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Fix part rotations not being reset to their pristine value when a non-landed vessel is packed, resulting in permanent part rotation drift when docking and other minor/cosmetic issues.
- **[PartStartStability](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/9)** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Fix vessel deformation and kraken events on flight scene load, also prevent some kraken issues when placing parts with EVA construction.

- **AutostrutActions** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Allow autostrut mode to be toggled with action groups (requires advanced tweakables to be enabled).
- **UIFloatEditNumericInput** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Allow numeric input ("#" button) in "float edit" PAW items<br/><img src="https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/raw/master/Screenshots/UIFloatEditNumericInput.gif"/>
- **DisableManeuverTool** [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Allow disabling the KSP 1.12 maneuver/trip planner tool in the KSPCF in-game settings menu. It can cause stutters and freezes on scene load, when changing SOI or when editing maneuver nodes, especially with Kopernicus modified systems.
- **FairingMouseOverPersistence** [KSP 1.10.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Make the "Fairing Expansion" state persistent when reloading a craft in the editor.
- [**AutoSavedCraftNameAtLaunch**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/30) [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Append `[Auto-Saved Ship]` when relevant in the Launchpad / Runway UI.<br/><img src="https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/raw/master/Screenshots/AutoSavedCraftNameAtLaunch.png" width="200"/>
- [**ShowContractFinishDates**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/36) [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>For archived contracts, show accepted/finished dates.
- **NoIVA** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Allow to disable IVA functionality and prevent related assets from being loaded, reducing RAM/VRAM usage and slightly increasing performance in some cases. Has a "use placeholder IVA" option allowing to keep crew portraits. This patch is disabled by default and must be enabled from the KSP "ESC" settings menu. It has no entry in the `Settings.cfg` file and require a restart to take effect. Do not use this option alongside IVA mods like RPM or MAS.
- **DisableNewGameIntro** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Disable the "intro" popups appearing in the space center, VAB/SPH and tracking station upon creating a new career game. Disabled by default.

The Making History parts will still be available. Can be toggled from the KSPCF in-game settings (requires a restart), or from a MM patch (see `Settings.cfg`).
- **TargetParentBody** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Allow targeting the parent body of the current craft, or any body in the parent hierarchy.

#### Performance tweaks 

- **SceneLoadSpeedBoost** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Reduce scene switches loading time with large/modded saves by caching the current save in memory instead of loading it from disk.
- [**ForceSyncSceneSwitch**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/250) [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Forces all scene transitions to happen synchronously. Mainly benefits highly modded installs by reducing asset cleanup run count from 3 to 1. 
- **OnDemandPartBuoyancy** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Prevent the part buoyancy integrator from running when not needed. Improves performance for large part count vessels while in the SOI of a body that has an ocean (Kerbin, Eve, Laythe...)
- [**FastLoader**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/108) [KSP 1.12.3 - 1.12.5]<br/>Complete rewrite of the KSP asset/part loader : prevent GPU framerate limits from affecting loading speed, implement multithreaded asset loading (20% to 40% speedup depending on CPU & storage specs), provides an opt-in mechanism for caching PNG textures in the DXT5 format, also implements loading of additional DDS formats (see **BetterDDSSupport** patch in the API/modding tools section).
- **PQSUpdateNoMemoryAlloc** [KSP 1.11.0 - 1.12.5]<br/> Prevent huge memory allocations and resulting occasional stutter on PQS creation happening when moving around near a body surface.
- [**PQSCoroutineLeak**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/85) [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Prevent KSP from spawning multiple PQS update coroutines for the same PQS after scene switches and on other occasions, causing large performance degradation over time.
- [**MemoryLeaks**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/49) [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Fix a bunch of managed memory leaks, mainly by proactively removing `GameEvents` delegates originating from destroyed `UnityEngine.Object` instances on scene switches. Will log detected leaks and memory usage. Also see`Settings.cfg` to enable advanced logging options that can be useful to hunt down memory leaks in mods.
- [**ProgressTrackingSpeedBoost**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/57) [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Remove unused ProgressTracking update handlers. Provides a very noticeable performance uplift in career games having a large amount of celestial bodies and/or vessels.
- [**DisableMapUpdateInFlight**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/59) [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Disable the update of orbit lines and markers in flight when the map view isn't shown. Provides decent performance gains in games having a large amount of celestial bodies and/or vessels.
- [**CommNetThrottling**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/299) [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Implement a throttling mechanism preventing CommNet network updates from happening every frame. When this patch is enabled, network updates will only happen at a set interval of in-game seconds (default is 2.5s, configurable in `Settings.cfg`). This patch will cause events such as line of sight loss or acquisition, or comm link changes to happen with a slight delay, but provide a significant performance uplift in games having a large amount of celestial bodies and/or vessels.
- [**AsteroidAndCometDrillCache**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/67) [KSP 1.12.5]<br/>Reduce constant overhead of ModuleAsteroidDrill and ModuleCometDrill by using the cached asteroid/comet part lookup results from ModuleResourceHarvester. Improves performance with large part count vessels having at least one drill part.
- [**FewerSaves**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/80) [KSP 1.8.0 - KSP 1.12.5]<br/>Disables saving on exiting Space Center minor buildings (Mission Control etc) and when deleting vessels in Tracking Station. Disabled by default.
- [**ConfigNodePerf**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/88) [see also](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/90) [KSP 1.8.0 - KSP 1.12.5]<br/>Speeds up many ConfigNode methods, especially reading and writing ConfigNodes.
- [**RestoreMaxPhysicsDT**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/95) [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>When using physics warp, Unity will set the max physics dt to be at least as high as the scaled physics dt. But KSP will never restore it back to the normal value from the settings. This can degrade performance as it allows more FixedUpdates to run per frame.
- [**ContractProgressEnumCache**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/100) [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Prevent performance drops when there are in-progress comet sample or rover construction contracts
- [**DragCubeGeneration**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/139) [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5]<br/> Faster and more reliable implementation of drag cube generation. Improves overall loading times (both game load and scene/vessel/ship load times), prevent occasional lag spikes (in the editor mostly) and fix some issues causing incorrect drag cubes to be generated (notable examples are the stock inflatable heat shield, the 1.25m and 2.5m nose cones and the Mainsail shroud). Note that by design, this patch results in a small deviation from the stock behavior for buyoancy, aerodynamics and thermodynamics, as the generated drag cubes will be slightly different.
- **LocalizerPerf** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Faster and minimal-allocation replacements for the `Localizer.Format()` methods, can provide significant speedup for GUI-heavy mods using localized strings.
- [**DisableHiddenPortraits**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/84) [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Prevent non-visible crew portraits from being rendered after a switch back from the map view (and other cases), causing a significant perf hit when there are many kerbals in the vessel.
- **IMGUIOptimization** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Eliminate structural GC allocations and reduce performance overhead of OnGUI() methods. Can provide significant performance gains when having many mods using IMGUI heavily.
- [**CollisionManagerFastUpdate**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/174) [KSP 1.11.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>3-4 times faster update of parts inter-collision state, significantly reduce stutter on docking, undocking, decoupling and joint failure events.
- [**LowerMinPhysicsDTPerFrame**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/175) [KSP 1.12.3 - 1.12.5]<br/>Allow a min value of 0.02 instead of 0.03 for the "Max Physics Delta-Time Per Frame" main menu setting.  This allows for higher and smoother framerate at the expense of the game lagging behind real time.
- [**OptimizedModuleRaycasts**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/216) [KSP 1.12.3 - 1.12.5]<br/>Improve engine exhaust damage and solar panel line of sight raycasts performance by avoiding extra physics state synchronization and caching solar panels scaled space raycasts results. Also prevent useless constant overhead and raycasts in `ModuleSurfaceFX.Update()` (see [PR](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/303/)).
- [**ModuleDockingNodeFindOtherNodesFaster**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/257) [KSP 1.12.3 - 1.12.5]<br/>Faster lookup of other docking nodes.

- [**FloatingOriginPerf**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/257) [KSP 1.12.3 - 1.12.5]<br/>General micro-optimization of floating origin shifts. Main benefit is in large particle count situations (ie, launches with many engines) but this helps a bit in other cases as well.
- [**FasterPartFindTransform**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/255) [KSP 1.12.3 - 1.12.5]<br/>Faster, and minimal GC alloc relacements for the Part FindModelTransform* and FindHeirarchyTransform* methods.
- [**CraftBrowserOptimisations**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/284) [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Significantly reduces the time it takes to open the craft browser and to search by name. Most noticeable with lots of craft.
- [**OptimisedVectorLines**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/281) [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Improve performance in the Map View when a large number of vessels and bodies are visible via faster drawing of orbit lines and CommNet lines.

#### API and modding tools
- **MultipleModuleInPartAPI** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>This API allow other plugins to implement PartModules that can exist in multiple occurrence in a single part and won't suffer "module indexing mismatch" persistent data losses following part configuration changes. [See documentation on the wiki](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/wiki/MultipleModuleInPartAPI).
- **DockingPortLockedEvents** [KSP 1.12.2 - 1.12.5]<br/>Disabled by default, you can enable it with a MM patch. Fire GameEvents onRoboticPartLockChanging/onRoboticPartLockChanged respectively before/after calls to ModuleDockingNode.ModifyLocked(), following a modification of the ModuleDockingNode.nodeIsLocked field.
- **OnSymmetryFieldChanged** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/> Disabled by default, you can enable it with a MM patch. Change the `UI_Control.onSymmetryFieldChanged` callback to behave identically to the `UI_Control.onFieldChanged` callback :
  - The callback will only be called when the field value has actually been modified.
  - The "object" argument will contain the previous field value (instead of the new value).
- **PersistentIConfigNode** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Implement `IConfigNode` members marked as `[Persistent]` serialization support when using the `CreateObjectFromConfig()`, `LoadObjectFromConfig()` and `CreateConfigFromObject()` methods. Also implements `Guid` serialization support for those methods. Includes a complete rewrite of underlying ConfigNode code (in line with ConfigNodePerf) for performance, lower GC impact, and to fix some stock bugs.
- **ReflectionTypeLoadExceptionHandler** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>Patch the BCL `Assembly.GetTypes()` method to always handle (gracefully) an eventual `ReflectionTypeLoadException`. Since having an assembly failing to load is a quite common scenario, this ensure such a situation won't cause issues with other plugins. Those exceptions are logged (but not re-thrown), and detailed information about offending plugins is shown on screen during loading so users are aware there is an issue with their install. This patch is always enabled and has no entry in `Settings.cfg`.
- **[DepartmentHeadImage](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/47)** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/> Fix administration building custom departement head image not being used when added by a mod.
- **[ModUpgradePipeline](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/91)** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.5]<br/>This will save mod versions in sfs and craft files, and use those versions for mods' SaveUpgradePipeline scripts so that mods can handle their own upgrade versioning using native KSP tools instead of having to always run their upgrade scripts.
- **BetterDDSSupport** [KSP 1.12.3 - 1.12.5]<br/>Implement compatibility with the DXT10/DXGI specification, and support of loading additional texture formats :
  - `BC4` : single channel (R) compressed 4 bpp 
  - `BC5` : 2 channels (RG) compressed 8 bpp
  - `BC6H` : 3 channels (RGB) compressed 8 bpp with HDR color range (**Not available on MacOS**)
  - `BC7` : 4 channels (RGBA) compressed 8 bpp (**Not available on MacOS**)
  - `R16G16B16A16` : 4 channels (RGBA) uncompressed 64 bpp
  - `R16_FLOAT` / `R32_FLOAT` : single channel (R) uncompressed 16/32 bpp 
  - `R16G16_FLOAT` / `R32G32_FLOAT` : 2 channels (RG) uncompressed 32/64 bpp
  - `R16G16B16A16_FLOAT` / `R32G32B32A32_FLOAT` : 4 channels (RGBA) uncompressed 64/128 bpp
- [**KSPFieldEnumDesc**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/243) [KSP 1.12.2 - 1.12.5]<br/>Disabled by default, you can enable it with a MM patch. Adds display name and localization support for enum KSPFields. To use add `Description` attribute to the field.
- [**BaseFieldListUseFieldHost**](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/278) [KSP 1.12.3 - 1.12.5]<br/>Allow `BaseField` and associated features (PAW controls, persistence, etc) to work when a custom `BaseField` is added to a `BaseFieldList` (ie, a `Part` or `PartModule`) with a `host` instance other than the `BaseFieldList` owner. See the linked PR and code for use cases and example usage.

#### Stock configs tweaks
- **[ManufacturerFixes](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/62)**<br/>Fix a bunch of stock parts not having manufacturers, add icons for the stock "Stratus Corporation" and "LightYear Tire Company" and two new agents, "FreeFall Parachutes" and "Clamp-O-Tron".
- **[LandingGearLights](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/122)**<br/>Fix the lights on the "LY-10" and "LY-35" landing gears not automatically turning on/off when extending/retracting the landing gear.

### Localization

This mod supports localization. If you wish to contribute a localization file, you can have the mod generate or update a language template by editing the `Settings.cfg` (see instructions near the end of the file).

### Building

After loading the solution in your IDE, add a `ReferencePath` pointing to the root of your KSP install :

For Visual Studio, right-click on the `KSPCommunityFixes` project > `Properties` > `Reference Paths`, add the path to your KSP install and save the changes. Closing and re-opening the solution might be needed for the changes to propagate.

Alternatively, you can do that manually by creating a `KSPCommunityFixes.csproj.user` file next to the `KSPCommunityFixes.csproj` file, with the following content :
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project ToolsVersion="Current" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <ReferencePath>Absolute\Path\To\Your\KSP\Install\Folder</ReferencePath>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
Then close / re-open the solution.

Building in the `Debug` configuration will update the `GameData` folder in your KSP install, building in the `Release` configuration will additionally create a zipped release in the `Releases` repository root folder.

For incrementing the version, edit the `KSPCommunityFixes.version` KSP-AVC file, changes will be propagated to `AssemblyInfo.cs` when building in the `Release` configuration.

The `Start` action of the IDE will trigger a build, update the `GameData` files in the KSP install and launch KSP.
If doing so in the `Debug` configuration and if your KSP install is modified to be debuggable, you will be able to debug the code from within your IDE (if your IDE provides Unity debugging support).
